# VPC:

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a private, isolated network within a cloud environment, 
like AWS, where users can define and control their own network settings. 
It allows you to securely launch and manage resources, such as virtual machines and databases, 
in a private environment.

With a VPC, you can configure subnets, IP addresses, routing, and security settings, ensuring that your 
cloud resources are isolated from others while maintaining secure communication between them.

Common AWS VPC Networking Components:

- Subnets: Segments of the VPC's IP address range. 
- Internet Gateway: Connects VPC to the internet. 
- NAT Gateway: Allows internet access for instances in private subnets. 
- Route Tables: Rules directing network traffic. 
- Network Access Control Lists (NACLs): Firewall controlling traffic for subnets. 
- VPC Peering: Connects two VPCs privately. 
- Elastic IP addresses: Static IPv4 addresses for your account.
