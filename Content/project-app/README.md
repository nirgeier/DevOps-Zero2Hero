# Rick & Morty Proxy API

This is a simple Node.js application using Express and Axios that acts as a proxy to the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). It provides a simplified and formatted view of characters and episodes from the show.

## Features

- ✅ Health check endpoint  
- 🧑‍🚀 Fetch characters by page or all characters  
- 🎲 Get a random character  
- 📺 Fetch episodes by page or all episodes  
- 🎭 Get characters that appear in a specific episode  

All responses (except for errors) are returned in **plain text** with JSON objects listed line by line.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs (e.g., a character doesn't exist or the API is down), the server responds with:

{ "error": "Description of the problem" }
```

HTTP status codes are used appropriately (e.g., 404, 500).
