# Introduction to AWS

AWS is a popular public cloud platform that globally provides many services.

The public cloud revolutionized the way companies use technology as it brings with it many benefits.

Here we will cover the main benefits of the cloud:

## Scalability

AWS allows infrastructure to scale up or down based on demand, with a pay-as-you-go model.  
This flexibility saves companies lots of money, without the need for upfront investment.

## Reliability

AWS's data centers are across the globe, and spread over various topographical areas which make services fault-tolerant to natural disasters, etc.  
The services offer high-availability, and automated failover to ensure applications remain available.

## Security

AWS prioritizes security by offering various encryption, monitoring, and compliance services, to ensure that sensitive data is protected both in transit and at rest.

## Cost Efficiency

AWS offers various payment models to fit different use cases, including:
- **Pay-as-you-go** - to pay only for what you consume
- **Reserved Instances** - for long-term savings
- **Spot Instances** - for cost optimization during low demand periods

## Cloud Concepts

### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

This is a model of services that provides you with the bare-metal servers.  
You choose the resources (e.g., Processor, CPU, Memory, and Storage).  
In this class, you are responsible for the OS and above.  
AWS is only responsible for physical security, maintenance, and failure.

### PaaS - Platform as a Service

This is a model of services that provide you with a working platform, which allows you to manage and run a service without building or maintaining the underlying infrastructure.  
This allows developers to focus on development, easily scale on-demand, while AWS handles the availability, security, and maintenance of the infrastructure, OS, and runtime.

### SaaS - Software as a Service

This is a model of services that are fully hosted and managed by a provider.  
You don't need to install, update, or maintain the software.  
You only pay a subscription fee for the use of the software, usually offered over the web, and can be accessed over the internet.  
The service provider handles updates, patches, and new features, ensuring you have access to the latest features.

## Docs

AWS has amazing [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) and [white papers](https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/).
AWS provides the **[Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)** - which defines the responsibility relationship between AWS and a customer in regard to security and control of services.  
Another very helpful and important document is the **[AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)**, which provides architectural best practices and guidance for designing secure, reliable, and efficient workloads in the AWS cloud.
