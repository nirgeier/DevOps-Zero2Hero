## Detailed instructions how to contribute

### Getting Started
  
#### Fork the Repository

- Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account:
- Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner
- Clone your fork locally:
  ```bash
  # Clone the repository
  $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/DevOps-Zero2Hero.git
  
  # Navigate into the project directory
  $ cd DevOps-Zero2Hero-NAME
  ```

#### Making Changes

##### Generating ssh key

  - Make sure you have a setup an SSH key for GitHub. 
  - If you don't have one, follow these steps to generate and add your SSH key to GitHub.
    - Generate an SSH key:
      ```bash
      # Generate rsa key
      ssh-keygen -t rsa 

      # Follow the prompt to save the key to a file (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`)
      # You can also specify a different file name by using `-f` option, e.g: 
      # ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/mykey
      ```
    - This will create a new file named `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` in your home directory unless you gave it a different name
  - Copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` and paste it under "SSH key" field in  your GitHub account settings.

##### Setting up upstream
  
- Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
  ```bash
  # Add the original repository as an upstream remote
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:nirgeier/DevOps-Zero2Hero.git
  ```

##### Stay Updated

- Keep your fork in sync with the upstream repository:
  ```bash
  # Keep your fork in sync with the upstream repository
  git fetch --all

  # Merge upstream changes into your branch
  git merge upstream/main
  ```

##### Commit changes

  ```sh
  # Create branch for your changes.
  $ git checkout -b <your-branch-name>

  # Make changes locally on your local machine (clone).
  # Add the changes to your staging area
  $ git add .

  # Commit the changes
  $ git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

  # Push the changes to your forked repository.
