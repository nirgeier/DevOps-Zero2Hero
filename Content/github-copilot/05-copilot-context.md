## 1. What is GitHub Copilot Context?

- `Copilot Context` is a feature that allows developers to **provide additional context to GitHub Copilot**, enhancing its ability to generate relevant code suggestions. 
- `Copilot context` can be provided through comments, function names, and other 
- Using `Copilot context`, developers can guide Copilot to produce more accurate and context-aware code completions.
- This is particularly useful in large codebases or when working on complex projects where understanding the context is crucial for generating meaningful code.
- By providing clear and concise context, developers can improve the quality of the code suggestions generated by Copilot, making it a more effective tool for enhancing productivity and code quality.

## 2. GitHub Copilot Context(s)?

- The context can be provided in various ways, including:
- `Copilot context` can be provided through:
  | Context Type                     | Description                                                                                                                                      |
  | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | **Inline comments**              | Adding comments directly in the code to explain the purpose or functionality of a specific section.                                              |
  | **Function and variable names**  | Using descriptive names for functions and variables to convey their intended use.                                                                |
  | **Code structure**               | Organizing code logically to provide context about how different parts of the code relate to each other.                                         |
  | **Documentation**                | Including documentation strings or comments that describe the overall purpose and functionality of the code.                                     |
  | **Other contextual information** | Providing additional context through external documentation, README files, or other resources that explain the project's goals and requirements. |
- The more relevant and specific the context provided, the better Copilot can understand the developer's intent and generate appropriate code suggestions.
- `Copilot context` is based upon your code and the comments you write.
- Example of `Copilot context` which can be used (Based upon my VsCode settings when writting this):
  <img src="/resources/images/copilot/copilot_context_list.png" style="border-radius: 25px; padding: 10px; width:300px"/>
- The context is based on the code you are currently working on, including:
  - The current file
  - The files in the same directory
  - The files in the same repository
  - The files in the same organization
  - The files in the same GitHub account
