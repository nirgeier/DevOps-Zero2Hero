First of all, we'll ask ourself what is cloud computing? Cloud computing is the delivery of computing 
services (like storage, processing power and software)over the internet, rather than on local servers or 
personal devices. There are major three cloud providers - Amazon(AWS), Google(GCP) and 
Microsoft(Azure). we are going to talk about the most common use - AWS.

AWS(Amazon Web Services) provides a wide range of cloud-based services, including computing power, 
storage, databases and networking, to help businesses scale and grow. AWS allows companies to rent 
these services on-demand, making it easier to manage infrastructure and reduce costs.

AWS composed of Regions - a distinct geographical area where AWS has data centers. 
Each Region has their Availability zones which are data centers.

By using AWS services we get some benefits like:

1. Wide Range of Services
2. Scalability
3. Cost-Effective
4. Security
5. Flexibility
6. Innovate Faster
7. Global Network of Data Centers
8. Reliability
